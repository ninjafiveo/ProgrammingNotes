In Python, math operators are symbols that perform arithmetic operations on operands. Here are some of the basic math operators along with their definitions and examples:

Addition (+):

Definition: Adds the values on either side of the operator.
Example: 5 + 3 evaluates to 8.
Subtraction (-):

Definition: Subtracts the right-hand operand from the left-hand operand.
Example: 9 - 4 evaluates to 5.
Multiplication (*):

Definition: Multiplies the values on either side of the operator.
Example: 7 * 6 evaluates to 42.
Division (/):

Definition: Divides the left-hand operand by the right-hand operand.
Example: 8 / 2 evaluates to 4.0.
Floor Division (//):

Definition: Performs division and then rounds down to the nearest integer.
Example: 7 // 3 evaluates to 2.
Modulus (%):

Definition: Returns the remainder of the division of the left-hand operand by the right-hand operand.
Example: 9 % 4 evaluates to 1.
Exponentiation (**):

Definition: Raises the left-hand operand to the power of the right-hand operand.
Example: 3 ** 4 evaluates to 81.
Unary Minus (-):

Definition: Negates the value of the operand.
Example: If x = 5, then -x evaluates to -5.
Absolute Value (abs()):

Definition: Returns the absolute value of the operand.
Example: abs(-7) evaluates to 7.
Round (round()):

Definition: Rounds a number to the nearest integer, or to the specified number of decimals.
Example: round(5.765, 2) evaluates to 5.77.
