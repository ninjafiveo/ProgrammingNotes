# Glossary
## Python: A high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its easy readability with great design principles.

**Interpreter:** A program that reads and executes code, translating high-level source code into machine code line by line.

**Syntax:** The set of rules that defines how Python programs are written and interpreted.

**Variable:** A named location in memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the variable name.

**Data Type:** A classification identifying the type of a value, such as integer, string, list, etc.

**Integer:** A whole number without a fractional component.

**Float:** A number that has a decimal point.

**String:** A sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

List: An ordered and mutable collection of items, which can be of any type.

Tuple: An ordered and immutable collection of items.

Dictionary: An unordered collection of data in a key:value pair form.

Set: An unordered collection of unique items.

Boolean: A data type that can be either True or False.

Loop: A control structure used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

Conditionals: Statements that allow branching of code based on conditions (if, elif, else).

Function: A block of reusable code that performs a specific task.

Class: A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior.

Object: An instance of a class.

Inheritance: A mechanism in which one class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class.

Module: A file containing Python definitions and statements intended for reuse.

Package: A way of organizing related modules into a single directory hierarchy.

Exception: An error detected during execution, which can be handled by the programmer.

Try-Except: A construct to catch and handle exceptions.

Lambda Function: An anonymous, inline function defined with lambda.

Decorator: A function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.

Generator: A special type of iterator that allows on-the-fly generation of values.

List Comprehension: A concise way to create lists using a single line of code.

Slice: A subset of a collection, extracted using start:end:index notation.

Recursion: The process where a function calls itself as its subroutine.

Docstring: A string literal specified in source code that is used as a comment to document a specific segment of code.

Mutable: Refers to the ability of an object to be modified after it has been created. Lists and dictionaries are examples of mutable objects in Python.

Immutable: Refers to the inability of an object to be modified after it has been created. Strings and tuples are examples of immutable objects in Python.

Statement: A standalone unit of code that performs a specific action, such as assigning a value to a variable.

Expression: A combination of variables, operations, and values that yields a result value.

Block of Code: A group of programming statements that are grouped together, typically by indentation in Python.

Indentation: The use of whitespace at the beginning of a line to define the level of a block of code in Python.

Comment: Text within a program that is ignored by the interpreter, used to explain the code. Single-line comments in Python start with #.

Library: A collection of pre-written code modules that can be reused in a Python program.

Argument: A value passed to a function or method when calling it.

Parameter: A variable used to define a particular value during a functionâ€™s definition.

Return Value: The value a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes.

Scope: The region of a program where a variable can be accessed or modified.

Global Variable: A variable that is accessible throughout the entire program.

Local Variable: A variable that is only accessible within the function or block of code where it is defined.

Attribute: A value associated with an object, representing one of its properties.

Method: A function that is associated with an object and can access and modify its properties.

Self: A variable that represents the instance of an object itself in Python. It is used to access variables that belong to the object.

Constructor: A method that is automatically called when an object is created, usually denoted as __init__ in Python.

Instance Variable: A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.

Class Variable: A variable that is shared by all instances of a class, defined within the class.

Namespace: A container that holds a set of identifiers (names), where each name is associated with a unique object.

Garbage Collection: The process by which Python automatically frees up memory that is no longer in use.

Iterables: Objects that can be iterated over, such as lists, strings, tuples, and dictionaries.

Iterator: An object representing a stream of data, returned by the iter() function, and implements a __next__() method to access elements one at a time.

Dynamic Typing: The feature in Python that allows a variable to change its type during the runtime.

Duck Typing: A programming concept in Python where the type or the class of an object is less important than the methods it defines or the operations it supports.

List Slicing: The technique in Python to extract a portion or slice from a list.

Regular Expression (Regex): A sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, used for pattern matching with strings.

Comprehension: A concise way to create collections in Python using a single line of code, such as list, set, and dictionary comprehensions.

GIL (Global Interpreter Lock): A mechanism used by the CPython interpreter to ensure that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, which can be a bottleneck in CPU-bound and multithreaded code.
