<h1>Glossary</h1>
<b>Python:</b> A high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its easy readability with great design principles.

Interpreter: A program that reads and executes code, translating high-level source code into machine code line by line.

Syntax: The set of rules that defines how Python programs are written and interpreted.

Variable: A named location in memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the variable name.

Data Type: A classification identifying the type of a value, such as integer, string, list, etc.

Integer: A whole number without a fractional component.

Float: A number that has a decimal point.

String: A sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

List: An ordered and mutable collection of items, which can be of any type.

Tuple: An ordered and immutable collection of items.

Dictionary: An unordered collection of data in a key:value pair form.

Set: An unordered collection of unique items.

Boolean: A data type that can be either True or False.

Loop: A control structure used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

Conditionals: Statements that allow branching of code based on conditions (if, elif, else).

Function: A block of reusable code that performs a specific task.

Class: A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior.

Object: An instance of a class.

Inheritance: A mechanism in which one class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class.

Module: A file containing Python definitions and statements intended for reuse.

Package: A way of organizing related modules into a single directory hierarchy.

Exception: An error detected during execution, which can be handled by the programmer.

Try-Except: A construct to catch and handle exceptions.

Lambda Function: An anonymous, inline function defined with lambda.

Decorator: A function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.

Generator: A special type of iterator that allows on-the-fly generation of values.

List Comprehension: A concise way to create lists using a single line of code.

Slice: A subset of a collection, extracted using start:end:index notation.

Recursion: The process where a function calls itself as its subroutine.

Docstring: A string literal specified in source code that is used as a comment to document a specific segment of code.
