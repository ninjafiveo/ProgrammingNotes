# Hands on Quiz

Python Fundamentals Hands-On Exam
Objective: Demonstrate your understanding and proficiency in using various data types, functions, logic control, and loops in Python.
Environment: Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Google Classroom
Instructions:
Setup Your Environment:
Open Visual Studio Code.
Create a new Python file named python_fundamentals_exam.py.
Initialize a new git repository in your project directory and commit your changes regularly.
Create a new repository on GitHub and push your local repository to GitHub.
Tasks:
Task 1: Data Types
Create a variable labeled “intro”  with the value of  “Hello World” and print to the value terminal.
Create a variable labeled “first_name” that takes in the user input and then prints the value of the first_name value to the terminal.
Create the variables age(int), temperature(float), too_hot(boolean) and assign your age, today’s temp(using a decimal for precise value) and the boolean value if you think it’s too hot or too cold respectively.
Print the type of each variable.
Take the age variable and temperature variable and perform the following math operations to the two numbers (add, subtract, multiply, divide and square) then print the values to the console.
Concatenate and print the two string variables above of “intro” and “first_name”.
When done with this section, commit and push your code to Github
Task 2: Functions
Define a function named calculate_area that takes the length and width as parameters and returns the area of a rectangle.
Call this function with different arguments and print the results.
When done with this section, commit and push your code to Github
Task 3: Logic Control
Write an if-elif-else statement that prints whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
Test your logic control structure with different numbers.
When done with this section, commit and push your code to Github
Task 4: Loops
Create a list of 5 different numbers (your choice)
Write a for loop that iterates over your list of numbers and prints the square root of each number.
Write a while loop that calculates the list of numbers and prints the cubed value of each number.
When done with this section, commit and push your code to Github
Commit and Push to GitHub:
Regularly commit your changes with meaningful commit messages.
Push your commits to your GitHub repository.
Submission:
Once you have completed all tasks, ensure that your code is pushed to your GitHub repository.
Submit the link to your GitHub repository on Google Classroom for grading.
Evaluation Criteria:
Correctness and completeness of the code.
Proper usage of different data types, functions, logic control structures, and loops.
Regular and meaningful commits to GitHub.
Code readability and organization.
Good Luck!
